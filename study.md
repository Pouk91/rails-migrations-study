## Explain the Role of Migrations

In your own words, define migrations and explain why developers use them.

```md
Migrations are a way to add/remove tables or columns from your database schema. Developers use migrations to implement new versions of the database schema.
```

## Reference Documentation for Migrations

In ActiveRecord Migrations, what is the name of the method the creates a new
table?

```md
create_table
```

What is the name of the method that creates a new column?

```md
add_column
```

Suppose that an application needs a table called `pets` with the columns `name`
and `breed`, both of which are strings. `name` cannot be blank and must be
unique. Write the migration would be used to create a table satisfying these
requirements.

```ruby
create_table :pets do |p|
  p.string :name, null: false
  p.string :breed
end
```

## Explain the Role of Seed Data

In your own words, explain the role of application seed data.

```md
Seed data is the default data to an application. For example if an application had an adminstrator. Users wouldn't be able to access the adminstrator data on the UI, but if you're a developer you can access the applications back end adminstrator seed data.
```

Should seed data be used for experimentation during development?

```md
Yes because the seeds feature will reload the database frequently in the test and development environments.
```
